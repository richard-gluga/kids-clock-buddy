# What is Kids Clock Buddy?

Kids Clock Buddy is a fun and educational clock that's customizable and perfect for kids of all ages!

It is especially useful for training little ones as young as 12 months about when to sleep and when to wake up. Just put a tablet or phone on a dock or wall, and customize the clock to show only the main hour. Kids can very quickly understand that "7" means wake up time, but "6" is still sleep time (giving you that much needed extra rest too). The clock can also act as a night-light.

When you travel, just put the app on your phone and rest it somewhere the kids can see wherever they may be. This gives them calmness and familiarity, helping them sleep in hotels, grandparents places, and so on.

As kids grow, start to enable more features like the minute and seconds circles.

# Tech Details

This is a HTML/JavaScript web app using basic SVG rendering. The app is hosted on Firebase at
https://kids-clock-buddy.web.app. It is also made available as an Android App by using
a Trusted Web Activity which just wraps the web-app and opens it in full-screen mode in an
embedded Chrome tab (different from WebView).

The Android app is available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gluga.clockbot
